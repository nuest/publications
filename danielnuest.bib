  Abstract                 = {Environmental sensors have continuously improved by becoming smaller, cheaper, and more intelligent over the past years. As consequence of these technological advancements, sensors are increasingly deployed to monitor our environment. The large variety of available sensor types with often incompatible protocols complicates the integration of sensors into observing systems. The standardized Web service interfaces and data encodings defined within OGC’s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework make sensors available over the Web and hide the heterogeneous sensor protocols from applications. So far, the SWE framework does not describe how to integrate sensors on-the-fly with minimal human intervention. The driver software which enables access to sensors has to be implemented and the measured sensor data has to be manually mapped to the SWE models. In this article we introduce a Sensor Plug & Play infrastructure for the Sensor Web by combining (1) semantic matchmaking functionality, (2) a publish/subscribe mechanism underlying the SensorWeb, as well as (3) a model for the declarative description of sensor interfaces which serves as a generic driver mechanism. We implement and evaluate our approach by applying it to an oil spill scenario. The matchmaking is realized using existing ontologies and reasoning engines and provides a strong case for the semantic integration capabilities provided by Semantic Web research.},

  Abstract                 = {The Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) architecture of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has reached a broad acceptance. However, although the core specifications reached a mature state, the integration of a cataloguing service for sensors has not yet been achieved. Previous work focused on registries that address the specifics of dynamic sensor networks, on mechanisms for handling the semantics of phenomena and on metadata models based on the Sensor Model Language (SensorML). This work describes how existing elements supporting sensor discovery can be coupled with the already well established OGC Catalogue Service (CSW). The approach presented in this work relies on a SensorML profile specifying metadata necessary and sufficient for sensor discovery. SensorML documents that conform to the profile are automatically harvested from SWE services by a lower level registry and are subsequently transformed into an information model supported by the CSW. Finally the metadata is pushed into CSW instances and becomes available through the CSW interface. In summary, this work presents for the first time a working example how resources provided through SWE services can automatically be published through common OGC Catalogue Service instances. We expect that the presented approach is an important step in order to achieve a full integration of SWE components into spatial data infrastructures and to offer SWE services to a broader audience.},

  Abstract                 = {We present demonstrations of the GEO label Web services and their integration into a proto-
type extension of the GEOSS portal (http://scgeoviqua.sapienzaconsulting.com/web/guest/geo_home),
the GMU portal (http://gis.csiss.gmu.edu/GADMFS/) and a GeoNetwork catalog application
(http://uncertdata.aston.ac.uk:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/main.home). The GEO label is designed to commu-
nicate, and facilitate interrogation of, geospatial quality information with a view to supporting efficient and
effective dataset selection on the basis of quality, trustworthiness and fitness for use.

The GEO label which we propose was developed and evaluated according to a user-centred design (UCD)
approach in order to maximise the likelihood of user acceptance once deployed. The resulting label is dynamically
generated from producer metadata in ISO or FDGC format, and incorporates user feedback on dataset usage,
ratings and discovered issues, in order to supply a highly informative summary of metadata completeness and
quality. The label was easily incorporated into a community portal as part of the GEO Architecture Implementation
Programme (AIP-6) and has been successfully integrated into a prototype extension of the GEOSS portal, as well
as the popular metadata catalog and editor, GeoNetwork.

The design of the GEO label was based on 4 user studies conducted to: (1) elicit initial user requirements;
(2) investigate initial user views on the concept of a GEO label and its potential role; (3) evaluate prototype
label visualizations; and (4) evaluate and validate physical GEO label prototypes. The results of these studies
indicated that users and producers support the concept of a label with drill-down interrogation facility, combining
eight geospatial data informational aspects, namely: producer profile, producer comments, lineage information,
standards compliance, quality information, user feedback, expert reviews, and citations information. These are
delivered as eight facets of a wheel-like label, which are coloured according to metadata availability and are
clickable to allow a user to engage with the original metadata and explore specific aspects in more detail. To
support this graphical representation and allow for wider deployment architectures we have implemented two
Web services, a PHP and a Java implementation, that generate GEO label representations by combining producer
metadata (from standard catalogues or other published locations) with structured user feedback. Both services
accept encoded URLs of publicly available metadata documents or metadata XML files as HTTP POST and GET
requests and apply XPath and XSLT mappings to transform producer and feedback XML documents into clickable
SVG GEO label representations. The label and services are underpinned by two XML-based quality models. The
first is a producer model that extends ISO 19115 and 19157 to allow fuller citation of reference data, presentation
of pixel- and dataset- level statistical quality information, and encoding of ‘traceability’ information on the lineage
of an actual quality assessment. The second is a user quality model (realised as a feedback server and client) which
allows reporting and query of ratings, usage reports, citations, comments and other domain knowledge.

Both services are Open Source and are available on GitHub at https://github.com/lushv/geolabel-
service and https://github.com/52North/GEO-label-java. The functionality of these services can be tested
using our GEO label generation demos, available online at http://www.geolabel.net/demo.html and

  Abstract                 = {The EC FP7 GeoViQua project has focussed in including quality information into the GEO Portal to increase
the visibility of it and increase trust in the GEOSS data products. GeoViQua has fully adopted and extended the
ISO19115 metadata model and the XML encoding, incorporating the ISO19157 concepts as new XML elements
(pending the official XML encoding) but adding new elements detected as missing aspects in the model. This
makes possible an easy transition and coexistence of both models in the GEO portal.

The GEOSS Portal enables the user to discover data introducing keywords and other filtering criteria. Once the
list of results is returned, the user can read more about each result based on the metadata available in the GEOSS
catalogues. In GeoViQua, we developed several metadata-based visualization tools through applying an XSLT
allowing specialized visualization focused in different aspects. A provenance-based visualization tool emphasising
the sequence of processes and data sources and its detailed description, has been integrated. It is also possible
to assess the completeness of the metadata records using an extension of an initially developed by NOAA tool
that is now enriched with quality indicators assessment. A metadata comparison tool is able to present metadata
document side-by-side allowing parallel reading of the different metadata tags. Furthermore, numerical values are
automatically compared and the best one is illuminated in green background colour, and a star plot and a parallel
coordinates plot are used to easily show a graph with the best dataset as the large polygon and the highest line.
Each summary result combines both producer metadata with the possibility for the user to submit feedback
consisting in ratings, comments, expert reviews, links to documentation and new quality indicators. Previous
feedback items, coming for other users are shown next to the summary producer metadata. Also the both sum-
maries and extended descriptions of each result are accompanied by a GEO label (i.e. a graphical representation
of the presence and content of some aspects of the metadata that users data users interviewed by the project found
important for them. Additionally, an special icon indicates the presence, and the possibility of showing in a WMS
client, data values combined with other pixel level quality estimators in a single view (e.g. the mean and the
variance of a measure that has an spatial distribution).

The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework
Programme (FP7/2010-2013) under grant agreement no. 265178.},

  Abstract                 = {Technical advances in mobile in-situ sensors open up new opportunities for providing an unprecedented amount of live environmental sensor data and allow measuring the same phenomenon at different times and places. If a phenomenon�s characteristics allow (and often even if they do not), spatial interpolation of potentially sparse measurements is used to infer values at not-probed locations and thus increasing spatial coverage. However, this coverage can misleadingly suggest a non-existing level of detail. Interpolation techniques often assume the measurements as snapshot of one point in time. But having a moving sensor one must consider the temporal and spatial variation of both sensor and the spatially distributed phenomenon as the age of a measurement has an impact on the interpretability of a value. 
This work develops methods combining the visualisation of sensor platforms and interpolations based upon the sensor�s observations. The goal is to increase the understanding of the observed dynamic environmental properties by creating a specialised information product from sensor data. The methods utilize explorative data analysis (Andrienko and Andrienko, 2006), i.e. they leverage the user's experience and vision capabilities in combination with interactive parameters to create multiple critical views on the data supporting a trial & error process .
We conclude that a concurrent interactive specialised visualisation is a reasonable first step to provide the user with an idea of contextual uncertainty for interpolations based on mobile sensors. While existing research and visualisations cover rather large stationary sensor networks, the approach of "few but mobile" sensors requires further work not only in the fields of hardware and communication, but also in time-aware presentations.},

  Abstract                 = {The sos4R package provides simple yet powerful access to OGC Sensor Observation Service instances. The package supports both encapsulation
and abstraction from the service interface for novice users as well as powerful request building for specialists. sos4R is motivated by the idea to close the gap between the Sensor Web and tools for (geo-)statistical analyses. It implements the core profile of the SOS specification and supports temporal, spatial, and thematical filtering of observations. This document brie y introduces the SOS specification. The package's features are explained extensively: exploration of service metadata, request building with filters, function exchangeability, result data transformation.
The package is published under GPL 2 license within the geostatistics community of 52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software.},

  Abstract                 = {Open source software is particularly suitable for teaching and organisations like Teaching Open Source (http://teachingopensource.org) present actively advertise this. In this talk we want to present some practical benefits that open source programming and publishing software on an open online platform has for teaching project-oriented software engineering seminars at university level. In these courses students together develop a new system for a specific task in form of a group project. For project groups, we suggest to use an adjusted variant of Scrum for project management (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29), git as source code management system (http://git-scm.com/), and GitHub as a collaboration platform (http://github.com/, https://education.github.com/). Thanks to GitHub�s collaboration models such as �fork & pull�, each student�s work, may they be in lines of code or contributions to a discussion, can be tracked. Students fulfil different tasks in a project setting: some develop, some spend their time issuing bugs or improving documentation. But for all of them GitHub allows to quantify contributions and set concrete goals, e.g. two pull requests created, one merged, and five issues written. GitHub also offers graphical overviews of project activities. The goal is of course not to expose the student but to create a transparent environment for evaluation and grading. Teachers can even weigh in on discussions and make suggestions on the same platform as the students.
In our experience, students estimate very well their performance in comparison with their colleagues. However, using Scrum as a development model is challenging for them. We adopted the classic Scrum schedule and defined two week long sprints. Students sometimes quarrel with the role of supervising other students and delegating tasks among their peers. But in the end, the clear schedule and the focus on the iterative and communicative aspects of project management are a key to ensure success. Teachers should be ready to step in a Scrum masters and to support the product owners and must be open to adjust plans and expectations in the same way that the students have to.
We think this approach can considerably increase quality of a course from both a teaching and a learning perspective. A few examples: it reduces workload on lecturers and teaching assistants; it makes individual contributions in group work identifiable; it confronts students with the reality of modern software development, which is collaborative and agile; both teachers and students are regularly forced to evaluate and improve the process; students build an online portfolio of their code and learn to work in an open source environment. Our goal with this talk is to share experiences with other people who teach programming-related courses and encourage other to utilise GitHub as a collaboration platform (see also https://github.com/blog/1817-octotales-uc-berkeley).},

  Abstract                 = {More and more information technology is moving into a cloud-based infrastructures for both data storage as well as user interfaces. With the advancement of browser technology, especially regarding Javascript engines, the user interfaces follow this move based on HTML5, also for mobile devices. One key advantage is clear: users always use the latest version and the environment is well controlled: an internet browser. General purpose libraries (e.g. jQuery), frameworks with user interfaces (e.g. Dojo Widgets) as well as web-application libs (e.g. AngularJS) facilitate the development of complex applications. In the geospatial domain, such frameworks and libraries are are successfully used to build complex applications and are often based on OpenLayers (OL) or Leaflet for mapping and visualisation. These libs support display of geospatial data coming from standardized view and feature services, most importantly the Open Geospatial Consortium�s (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Features Service (WFS). Both server and client libraries are mature and have reached a very stable level and wide distribution.
What is missing today are generic libraries that operate at the same level of performance and quality to (i) access observation and time series data, for example coming from OGC Sensor Observation Services (SOS) as part of the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) suite of standards, and (ii) control processes published online, for examples as an OGC Web Processing Service (WPS). These standards are less widespread than WMS and WFS but gain momentum as data volumes increase, for example with a myriad of smart sensors in the internet of things or new EO satellite missions, and subsequent requirements for sophisticated architectures for (event-based) processing and management of time series data. SWE standards have just reached their second versions; a new WPS standard is currently under development.
Observing these developments lead to the birth of two new open source Javascript library projects that are presented in this talk. SOS.js is a Javascript framework to access SOS data and build sophisticated lightweight browser applications for discovering and displaying time series data as plots, tables, and maps. It consists of two modules: core and user interface. wps-js is a Javascript client library for the WPS generating forms based on the standardized metadata from the service and interactively creating and submitting processing tasks. It uses a templating mechanism for XML building and an internal Javascript class hierarchy. Both libraries are based on OL�s request and response encoding. During the talk we will demonstrate sample applications build with the libraries and share experiences of developing client libraries for XML-based standardized web services with Javascript, which include programming as well as project build and management lessons. One goal for both libraries is to become independent of OL and provide service access with a minimal footprint, for example to display data without maps. Might OL and Leaflet eventually use these libraries instead of their own client implementations for SOS and WPS? We see an advantage of developing such small and focussed libraries maintained by field experts in these non-mainstream domains. We�ll happily discuss if this is the best approach and pose the following question: Is there a (technical, organisational) way to build a compatible Javascript client frameworks across all geo-service standards?
We conclude that Javascript is ready to handle raw (timeseries) data and it is used more than ever. Also, both the standards and their open source implementations are ready for operational deployments. So it is now time to spread them further by increasing the usability with good browser client applications based on small and flexible open source libraries. While the presented libraries are developed withing the 52�North communities we want to use this talk to actively reach out to members of other open source projects to seek collaborators and to organise interoperability tests to make these tools useful for a broader community.},

  Abstract                 = {Interoperable data exchange and reproducibility are increasingly important for modern scientific research. This paper shows how three open source projects work together to realize this: (i) the R project, providing the lingua franca for statistical analysis, (ii) the Open Geospatial Consortium's Sensor Observation Service (SOS), a standardized data warehouse service for storing and retrieving sensor measurements, and (iii) sos4R, a new project that connects the former two. We show how sos4R can bridge the gap between two communities in science: spatial statistical analysis and visualization on one side, and the Sensor Web community on the other. sos4R enables R users to integrate (near real-time) sensor observations directly into R. Finally, we evaluate the functionality of sos4R. The software encapsulates the service's complexity with typical R function calls in a common analysis workflow, but still gives users full flexibility to handle interoperability issues. We conclude that it is able to close the gap between R and the sensor web.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers often create redundant methods for downloading, manipulating, and analyzing data from online resources. Moreover, the reproducibility of science can be hampered by complicated and voluminous data, lack of time for documentation and long-term maintenance of software, and fear of exposing programming skills. The combination of these factors can encourage unshared one-off programmatic solutions instead of openly provided reusable methods. Federal and academic researchers in the water resources and informatics domains have collaborated to address these issues. The result of this collaboration is a suite of modular R packages that can be used independently or as elements in reproducible analytical workflows. These documented and freely available R packages were designed to fill basic needs for the effective use of water data: the retrieval of time-series and spatial data from web resources (dataRetrieval, geoknife), performing quality assurance and quality control checks of these data with robust statistical methods (sensorQC), the creation of useful data derivatives (including physically- and biologically-relevant indices; GDopp, LakeMetabolizer), and the execution and evaluation of models (glmtools, rLakeAnalyzer). Here, we share details and recommendations for the collaborative coding process, and highlight the benefits of an open-source tool development pattern with a popular programming language in the water resources discipline (such as R). We provide examples of reproducible science driven by large volumes of web-available data using these tools, explore benefits of accessing packages as standardized web processing services (WPS) and present a working platform that allows domain experts to publish scientific algorithms in a service-oriented architecture (WPS4R). We assert that in the era of open data, tools that leverage these data should also be freely shared, transparent, and developed in an open innovation environment.},
